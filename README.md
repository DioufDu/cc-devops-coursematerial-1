# Course Material: Continuous Delivery & DevOps 

## Goals

![](overview.png)

#### Implement Continuous Delivery and DevOps
* Learn to design and setup CD pipeline and DevOps infrastructure  
* Learn to operate CD pipeline, operate DevOps infrastructure  
* Learn to operate/run Cloud Application & apply DevOps methods, using monitoring, usage measurement, logging, tracing, feature toggles,â€¦   

## Course Outline 

##### 1. Introduction / Overview Cloud, Continuous Delivery, DevOps

##### 2. Introduction Cloud Foundry, Jenkins and Ruby

##### 3. Design & Setup CD Pipeline
- Design CD Pipeline & Done Criteria per CD stage
- Setup CD Pipeline
  - Cloud Foundry (organization, space, service plan), Jenkins, Ruby
  - Infrastructure-as-Code

##### 4. Operate CD Pipeline
- From CI to CD
- Qualify existing microservice-based cloud application across the CD Pipeline
- Test Automation, Continuous Integration, Quality metrics, Product Standards, etc.
- Release cloud application application into production
- Manual/Automated release, Continuous Deployment vs Delivery with/without Feature Toggle
- Deployment techniques, e.g. Blue/Green, Canary

##### 5. Operate Cloud Application
- Monitoring, Logging & Tracing  
  - Application Monitoring, Usage Monitoring  
  - Infrastructure Monitoring
- Incident handling  
  - Application level, e.g. Bug in V1.0 of software artifact -> BugFix -> CD Pipeline -> Release V1.1  
  - Infrastructure level, e.g. Health issue in CF (e.g. Too much load backing service) -> Alerting -> manual and/or automated adaptation
